# Running

## compare_indices.py

This is a script used to compare 2 indices. It can be used to see the changes between
new indices and old indices. An output file with name `counts_<index_name>_vs_<another_index_name>.json`
or `compared_<index_name>_vs_<another_index_name>.json` will be generated.

### flags

#### `--test-type`

Choose between `compare-counts` and `full-compare`

* `compare-counts` will show the count difference for indices.
* `full-compare` will show detailed doc difference for indices.

#### `--true-index` and `--test-index`

The base names of the two elasticsearch indices being tested. All
gdc_from_graph (annotation, case, file, project) subtypes will be tested.


### Usage

```bash
compare_indices.py --true-index dr33_active_merged --test_index dr33_active_merged_v2 --test-type compare_counts
```

# Architecture

## Build and Upload Process

The JSON index is built in the following steps:

0. Cache the graph from the database in memory
0. Filter out nodes from the graph that should be excluded
0. Cache commonly used information, e.g. case to file relationships
0. Visit each case, producing a case doc and all annotation and file docs for that case
0. Merge file docs together (to allow for multiple cases in a file doc)
0. Produce project summary docs
0. Validate produced docs

The index is uploaded to elasticsearch in the following steps:

0. Create a new index in naming scheme
0. Upload each doc type to index
0. On success, update the alias to point to new index
0. Cleanup/close old indexes

## Builders and Mappers

Esbuild consists of a `builder` and a `mapper` for the four indices it produces: project,
annotation, file, and case.

* The `mapper` produces the Elasticsearch mapping and contains basic traversals
* The `builder` produces JSON documents using the `mapper`

Most of the business logic for building indices is contained in the
`graph.common.builder.GraphIndexBuilder` class, which is inherited by
`graph.common.builder.ActiveGraphIndexBuilder` to implement the actual
build of the indices.

Builders exclude nodes that shouldn't be in the index (and therefore
public) based during the filtering step in the `is_node_indexed()`
function.

Each builder has a set of class variables that alter build behavior,
including but not limited to `mapper`, `file_mapping`,
`case_to_file_paths`, `unindexed_by_property`, `hidden_properties`.
Those that are required to be overloaded are listed in
`required_attrs`.

Each `case` document contains all of the files derived from it.  Each
`file` document in that case document contain a _pruned_ version of
the parent `case` document that contains only the direct ancestors of
the file, i.e. only those found along all paths from the file to the
case.  This re-nesting is done to allow additional filtering in
Elasticsearch.

Because file documents are produced by visiting a single case, the
traversal from that case to each file will only contain one case.
This means that file documents must be merged together in order to
contain all the cases they are derived from. This is done as follows:

0. for each file doc from `denormalize_case() -> (case_docs,
   file_docs, annotation_docs)`
0. if there is an existing doc for this file and the newly produced
   document contains a subtree for a case that is not in the old doc,
   then append the case subtree from the new doc to that of the old
   doc.

### Mappers

The mappers (see the `graph.common.mappings` module) produce the
_mapping_ (or schema) for Elasticsearch.  The common mappers is futher
extended in the active mapper which is used to produce the main mappings
for the indices which will be built in the builder.

The mappers have three main functions to produce mappings:
`get_{project,case,annotation,file}_es_mapping`.

The properties of each Entity (Node class) are dynamically added to
the mapping based on the GDC Dictionary.

The traversal tree in the active mappings is dynamic and based on
the graph structure.

# Trouble shooting

The active module contains a ActiveMimic builder which can be used
to test functionality against nodes, e.g. testing `builder.is_node_indexed(node)`
to troubleshoot nodes that are not showing up in the index.

```python
>>> from esbuild.graph.active.mimic import ActiveMimic
>>> from gdcdatamodel.models import Case
>>> mimic = ActiveMimic(None)
>>> mimic.is_node_indexed(Case())
[...][graph_index][   INFO] not indexed (unsubmitted state: <Case(None)>): None
False
```

# Installation

Before continuing you must have the following programs installed:

- [Python 3.13](http://python.org/)

## Pip

Project dependencies are managed using
[PIP](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). You can install
dependencies via

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And optionally any dev requirements via

```bash
pip install '.[dev]'
```

### Project Dependencies

If you are building to a local Elasticsearch installation, you will
need to install it manually.  On OSX you can install Elasticsearch via
`brew install elasticsearch`.

# Development

## Tests

Use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to run tests:

```
pip install tox
tox
```

The test suite data is visualized in a PDF
using [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) if you have installed
whenever the tests are run.

### Parallel testing

We are now able to run the tests in parallel, with `indexd_test_utils2`,
`pytest-postgresql`, `pytest-elasticsearch` and `pytest-xdist`.
To start test in parallel, run with the following command:
```bash
USE_RUNNING_ES=false USE_RUNNING_PG=false pytest tests -n auto
```

You have to export postgres path so `pg_config` is available for `pytest-postgresql`.

If your elasticsearch is not installed in default location or your are using opensearch,
set the following env:
```bash
ES_EXECUTABLE=/opt/homebrew/opt/opensearch/bin/opensearch
```

If you are using mac, you also need to set:
```bash
OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
```

## Setup pre-commit hook to check for secrets

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to setup pre-commit hooks for this repo.
We use [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) to search for secrets being committed into the repo.

To install the pre-commit hook, run
```bash
pre-commit install
```

To update the .secrets.baseline file run
```bash
detect-secrets scan --update .secrets.baseline
```

`.secrets.baseline` contains all the string that were caught by detect-secrets but are not stored in plain text. Audit the baseline to view the secrets .

```bash
detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline
```

# Production

This library was written with the intention of deploying via SaltStack
and
[tungsten](https://github.com/NCI-GDC/tungsten/tree/develop/tungsten).
